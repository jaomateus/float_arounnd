## Floaty 
### Le Wagon first project  - Nov 2022

Floaty is a, Airbnb clone developed during my Web Development Bootcap at Le Wagon Amsterdam. 

The first version of Floaty was developed with only Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS e Bootstrap. The only Javascript function it was done with Stimulus.

As a way to improve my skills and to experiment other technologies, Floaty has been improved. It's still an ongoing project.

List of improvements:

- The list of floaties has been updated to be refreshed with AJAX.
- The scroll down button was created with vailla Javascript.
- The list of floaties and the search functionality was updated to be done with AJAX + Fetch
- The navbar was recreated to be fully responsive
